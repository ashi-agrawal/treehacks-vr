      "description": "Best Friends Animal Society is the only national animal welfare organization dedicated to ending the killing of dogs and cats in America’s shelters. A leader in the no-kill movement, Best Friends runs lifesaving programs in partnership with over 1,700 rescue groups and shelters across the country, as well as regional adoption centers and the nation’s largest no-kill sanctuary for companion animals. Founded in 1984, Best Friends has helped reduce the number of animals dying in shelters nationwide from 17 million per year to an estimated 4 million. But there are still more than 9,000 dogs and cats killed every day in shelters, just because they don’t have safe places to call home. We are determined to get that number to zero by the year 2025. Working together with you, we will end the killy and Save Them All®."
